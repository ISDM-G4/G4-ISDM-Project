# Problem Definition
### Point of View (POV) Statements
The travel company needs a new call management system that organises their relationship managers based on their skillset so that they can be effectively put to work, as currently relationshp managers with varying skills handle varying customers.

The travel company with their new call system need to reach out to new potential customers who would not ordinarily call so that they can increase their customer base and thus increase profits.

Relationship managers who answer calls need to be routed to customers whose travel interests align with their knowledge because they need to make efficient and effective sales of travel packages.

Newly hired relationship managers need to have their skillset interpreted by the system so that they can be easily added to the new CMC.

Customers who call looking for advice need to be paired correctly with skilled relationship managers so that they can receive the information they are looking for.

Customers who call the agency need to be quickly routed to a human to talk because wasting time waiting for a connection will make them less likely to stay on call.

Relationship managers need to have the new system prioritise customers who are more likely to purchase a package because much time is wasted with customers who are unlikely to buy with the current system.

Customers who dial in during busy times need to be routed to an automated voice input system so that they can provide basic information, allowing them to be routed to the correct relationship manager.

The new system needs to keep statistics on customers in a database so that analysis can be performed to determine which customers are more likely to purchase travel packages and call back/answer.
