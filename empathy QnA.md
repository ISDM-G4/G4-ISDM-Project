# Q and A roleplay with relevant stakeholders
### Analyst/Developer (A) and End user (U)
**A:** What is your main reason for using a travel company?

**U:** I want to receive advice for a holiday or travel destination I have planned. A travel company will help me plan my itinerary.

**A:** Why would you prefer to call the travel company over visiting in person?

**U:** Calling is helpful when I don't have the time to visit or there are no agencies near me.

**A:** What do you expect as a service from the employee answering your call?

**U:** I expect them to be able to help me with any questions I have regarding the travel destination and for them to be knowledgeable enough to give me recommendations if I don't have any in mind.

### Analyst/Developer (A) and Relationship Manager (R)
**A:** What do you prefer about calls over direct customer visits?

**R:** A call allows me to work without any consideraion of the customer, other than what they're saying. I can focus on the work itself.

**A:** What's your biggest problem with the current calling system?

**R:** Often when I answer a call, I am not well equipped to answer their questions as I only have general information prepared beforehand. While I may specialise in specific packages, such as Europe, customers could be calling about Japan or the Phillipines and I would have to quickly bring up material that I'm unfamiliar with.

**A:** What do you expect out of the new system?

**R:** I'd like customers tailored specifically to my skillset, so that I can easily answer their questions without getting flustered trying to bring up materials and details on the package I'm trying to sell. The interactive voice response unit will also give me time to breathe during peak hours, letting customers answer basic questions so I don't have to go through them myself.

### Analyst/Developer (A) and Travel company/Product owner (P)
**A:** What do you expect to gain from this new system?

**P:** I expect a greater efficiency in call turnover rates and employee utilisation, allowing me to hire less relationship managers but have them work to their full potential. The call system should also be fast, as a lot of maintenance costs of the current call system goes to paying for long call times. This should give us a greater profit margin.

**A:** What do you think of the outbound call system?

**P:** I think it's great that it can bring in customers who are on the fence about their travel, or otherwise would have never heard of our agency before. I think it will greatly increase the number of customers we receive.
