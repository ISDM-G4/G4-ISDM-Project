Better tailored holiday packages, advice is given off a (firsthand) experience so the customer will have a more enjoyable time, matching similar RM's and end users means RM's can advise on what they wanted to change about their own experience and pass it to the end user. This more tailored package means customers are offered a specific type of product and not a generic product that other travel companies might offer which might have included poor activities.  
Customers develop deeper connections if the RM they are talking to is able to personalise a trip based on past experience, which from a business perspective means they are able to upsell/add to the product meaning higher profits.
failure can refer to failure in development which means money invested is waste or another type of failure is performanc/security failure where it can be hacked?
