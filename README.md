# G4-ISDM-Project

# Objective outline and problem definition
> (Steps 1 and 2 of Design Thinking Methodology)
### Objective
The objective of the project is to improve the operation of the company's call management centre to increase sales efficiency. The project will implement several new functions to the system to achieve this goal, largely involving improving the effectiveness of relationship managers by matching their strengths with calling customers. The new system will also improve rate of calls and allow for flow control to maximise sales per call and reduce expenditure on call times.

### Problem definition
The travel company is in need of a new call management system to improve sales efficiency. Relationship managers (RM) must be matched with customers based on both the RM's stastical profile and the customers. A tool known as the _Profiler tool_ will be used to develop these statistics. The system will use this information to select which RMs should attend to which customers. The new system must also be capable of effectively routing inbound calls depending on the customer's profile, prioritising those that are more likely to purchase packages. During peak times, an _Interactive Voice Response_ unit is required to prompt basic questions before an _Automatic Call Distributor_ routes the call to the first available RM. For outbound calls the system must be able to retrieve a list of potential customers using information from a database and then generate a suitable script for the matching RM that will handle the call.

### Point of View (POV) Statements
The following POV statements reflect the requirements of the new system and its objectives.

- The travel company needs a new call management system that organises their relationship managers based on their skillset so that they can be effectively put to work, as currently relationshp managers with varying skills handle varying customers.

- The travel company with their new call system need to reach out to new potential customers who would not ordinarily call so that they can increase their customer base and thus increase profits.

- Relationship managers who answer calls need to be routed to customers whose travel interests align with their knowledge because they need to make efficient and effective sales of travel packages.

- Relationship managers who answer targeted outbound calls need a prepared script/details generated by the system about the customer because a new customer will more likely stay on call if they are immediately engaged rather than probed with questions.

- Newly hired relationship managers need to have their skillset interpreted by the system so that they can be easily added to the new CMC, as the system will need their profiles to function.

- Customers who call looking for advice need to be paired correctly with skilled relationship managers so that they can receive the information they are looking for.

- Customers who call the agency need to be quickly routed to a human to talk because wasting time waiting for a connection will make them less likely to stay on call.

- Relationship managers need to have the new system prioritise customers who are more likely to purchase a package because much time is wasted with customers who are unlikely to buy with the current system.

- Customers who dial in during busy times need to be routed to an automated voice input system so that they can provide basic information, allowing them to be routed to the correct relationship manager.

- The new system needs to keep statistics on customers in a database so that analysis can be performed to determine which customers are more likely to purchase travel packages and call back/answer.

# Stakeholders
### Major stakeholders
- Travel Company (Product owner)
- Relationship Managers
- End-customers

### Minor stakeholders
- IT/Database engineer
- Call/Routing engineer

### Stakeholder information
**Travel Company (Product owner)** refers to the owner of the travel agency who employs relationship managers. The owner holds a stake in the system due to their ownership of the company and is the client of the software project.

**Relationship Managers** are employees of the travel agency who accept calls/enquiries from customers. Their role is to sell travel packages offered by the travel agency. The function of their role will largely remain similar in the new system but with enhancements to improve sales capability.

**End-customers** are those who seek to purchase travel packages from the agency. Customers are able to call the travel agency and are expected to be routed to a relationship manager to talk to. The new system will improve on this by allowing simple questions to be automatically answered before a relationship manager is connected with the customer.

**IT/Database engineer** is responsible for the handling of data regarding relationship manager statistics (their strengths, field of expertise, etc) and customers. Customer data will be used to measure sale probability. The database engineer is responsible for the management and correction of this private data.

**Call/Routing engineer** is responsible for the operation of the in-house call management centre software. They are responsible for the maintenance of the system (both old and new) and its day to day operation.

# Approach
> Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective.

# Explain the use of Scrum
> Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum you have used to carry out the procedure. In
your explanation, ensure that you outline activities from Scrum that you use.

# Assumptions
> List assumptions you have made in the systems analysis.

# Gain and Risk
> Discuss the competitive advantages might be gained in developing the new information
system. Identify and discuss the possible adverse effects for this Business if its information
system project fails.
